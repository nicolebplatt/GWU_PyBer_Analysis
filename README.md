# PyBer Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to expand on the current insight from our PyBer city and ride data. Specifically, this analysis includes:
1. A summary DataFrame of ride-sharing data by city type, 
2. A multi-line graph showing total weekly shares from January to April of 2019, and
3. A summary report detailing the findings by city type and suggested recommendations.

## Results
In reviewing a summary of the total rides, drivers, and fares by city type (rural, suburban, and urban), we see that despite urban cities having far more drivers and total rides resulting in higher total fares than its counterparts, average fares per ride and per driver are much higher in rural and suburban areas. This is not surprising both in terms of simple supply and demand as well as the likelihood of urban riders requesting quick/short distance rides at a lower cost.

We can see that urban markets are far more lucrative, pulling in ~$40,000 compared to suburban and rural markets, which pulled in 2 and 9 times less, respectively over the same time period. Urban markets also employ far more drivers. In fact, suburban markets have 5 times fewer drivers while rural markets employ a whopping 31 times fewer drivers than urban cities.

Average fares per ride are not as wide-ranging as average fares per driver across all three city types. In rural areas, average fares per ride are only 1.5 times higher than in urban cities, however, average fares per driver are $55.49 for rural areas and only $16.57 in urban areas (over 3 times difference). 

When we look specifically at weekly total fares from January through April of 2019, we are able to identify additional insight across the three city types.

It seems that all three markets experienced an increase in total fares the week ending February 24, 2019. We can see peaks across all three city types during this particular week in February. 

It also appears that urban markets specifically were much more volatile in the month of March than during any other month. Although total fares remained within the $2,000-$2,000 per week range, there were significant swings throughout this range not seen by the other city types.

## Summary
Based on the above findings, here are three business recommendations for PyBer executives:

1. Urban markets seem the most obvious choice in terms of business expansion. They have the most opportunity to increase revenue by way of fares since there are clear signs of interest for both riders and drivers. Expanding to new cities would be an obvious and fruitful next step.

2. PyBer should research and analyze social, political, and/or environmental events that mightâ€™ve occurred during the week ending February 24th to better understand why all markets peaked that week. This could help us understand and align with future likely events and possibly impose surge pricing or additional "tax" to capitalize on demand.

3. Lastly, we may be able to entice drivers in rural and suburban areas on account of the higher fares per ride and higher fares per driver. This would increase supply but come with additional benefits: it would allow drivers more flexibility over their calendars and likely improve wait times for riders in less populated areas. Thus, more drivers in rural and suburban cities might motivate riders to chose PyBer as their preferred mode of transportations.
